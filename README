The book "The Evolution Of Cooperation" (by Robert Axelrod) was a great work. You should definitely check it out here:

However, the software emulating its system was implemented with Fortran, and hardly readable. (See it at http://www.cscs.umich.edu/Software/CC/ECHome.html ) I want to rebuild it and make it more readable, probably make it an online system and invite people all over the world to contribute their strategies. 

That's it. Read the book if you haven't.
